' My birthday is 7-15-81 so if there are any people out there around my
' age who are into programming e-mail me.

' I've been working on this program since I was in Middle School.
' It's based on a program I saw in a book in the school library, but their
' version sucked big time, so I decided to write a cooler one.

' Learn how to modify keywords and phrases in the instructions
' around line 150...

' I decided to upload it because one of the first programs I downloaded
' from the The Q-Basic Page [www.qbasic.com] was one called 'CHAT'
' by Mallard.

' You can e-mail him at "mallard@gcomm.com" or visit his web page at
' "http://www.lookup.com/homepages/80948/qb/index.html"

' I'm working on my own web page at
' "http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/9083/xyzzy.htm" {Subject to change...}
' I don't expect to have anything up till April 1997, e-mail for more info.
